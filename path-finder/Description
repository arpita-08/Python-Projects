Maze Path Finder (BFS + Curses Animation)
This project is a terminal-based maze solver built using Python, BFS (Breadth-First Search),
and the curses library. The program visually animates the BFS algorithm as it searches for
the shortest path from the Start (O) to the Goal (X) inside the maze.

Maze Layout:
The maze is represented as a 2D list:
# → Walls
O → Start
X → Goal
' ' → Open paths
Yellow X’s → BFS path being explored
How It Works
1. Drawing the Maze (print_maze):
- Uses curses color pairs.
- White for walls/open paths, yellow for explored BFS path.
- j*2 spacing for readability.
2. Finding the Start (find_start):
- Scans maze to locate 'O'.
3. Getting Neighbors (find_neighbors):
- Returns valid up/down/left/right cells.
4. BFS Search (find_path):
- Uses queue for BFS.
- Tracks visited nodes.
- Animates search with time.sleep(0.1).
- Stops when 'X' is found.
5. main():
- Initializes curses.
- Runs BFS animation.
- Waits for keypress.

Summary:
- Maze traversal
- BFS shortest path
- Terminal animation
- Real-time path visualization
This project demonstrates a blend of algorithmic logic and visual terminal output.
